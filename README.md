# [`twai.dev`](https://twai.dev)

[`twai.dev`](https://twai.dev) is a website for sharing knowledge about AI tools and creative workflows for all things pony. Twai will teach you about generating and composing _good_ AI pony images with Stable Diffusion on your computer assuming you are an absolute beginner.

⚠️ **The website is currently under initial development. Stay tuned for updates on [tantabus.ai discord](https://tantabus.ai/pages/discord), which is the place for pony AI artists community!**

## Contributing

Any contribution is welcome! Edit existing or add new pages to share your knowledge about AI pony art. Fork the repo and create a pull request to suggest changes (see [this guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request) for details).

This repository contains the source code and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files that comprise the [twai.dev](https://twai.dev) website.

The website is built using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/). It's a simple and elegant framework for static websites that hides a lot of complexity from you. You don't need to be a TypeScript expert let alone a Vue expert to get around this repo.

### Previewing Changes

If you want to make changes to the website, you need to be able to preview the updated web pages locally.

Make sure you have [NodeJS installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager), then install the dependencies of the website with the following command.

```bash
npm install
```

Now you can run the local server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
