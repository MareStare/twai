# Publishing

Once your AI art is finished, you can share it with the world on any websites of your choice. Such websites have rules and limitations for posting AI content. You _must_ know them before publishing your work.

Let's review some popular websites, where you'd want to post your AI art.

## <i class="tantabus inline-logo"></i> [Tantabus](https://tantabus.ai)

This is the go-to website for posting almost any AI art with ponies. It is central to AI pony artists community, and we'd be glad to see your works here! You can post fully generated or edited AI art rating from SFW to NSFW with reasonable quality.

Citing the [relevant site rules](https://tantabus.ai/pages/rules):

> Images not made by or with AI should have a clear relation to the topic, or oneâ€™s workflow. For example, a guide on how to use a tool, or a sketch to be used for a controlnet image.

Now let's learn how to properly tag our AI art.

### `ai generated` tag

This tag is for images, that were purely AI generated with little to no editing and clean-up. They must follow [the base quality standards](https://tantabus.ai/pages/aibasequality) and have the following tags:

```csv
ai content, ai generated, prompter:{author_name}
```

### `ai composition` tag

This tag is for images, that were heavily edited, used extensive inpainting, were based on a hand-made sketch or alike. They must follow [the higher quality standards](https://tantabus.ai/pages/aicompquality) and should be tagged with:

```csv
ai content, ai composition, editor:{author_name}
```

::: tip ðŸ‘€

Notice the difference in `editor`/`prompter` tags between `ai generated` and `ai composition`.

See the [tag guidelines](https://tantabus.ai/pages/tags) for more.

### History

This whole guide was written at the time when Tantabus was [spun off from Derpibooru](https://derpibooru.org/forums/meta/topics/policy-update-regarding-ai-content) and became a home for AI pony artists. If you have any questions about AI pony art or Tantabus not answered in this guide or just want to join our community, then enter the [Tantabus Discord server](https://tantabus.ai/pages/discord).

Derpibooru has strict content requirements for AI art. Citing [their rules](https://derpibooru.org/pages/rules):

> -   Do not upload purely `ai generated` images. AI can be used as a tool to edit or create images, such as for `ai composition` content, but not as the only tool. Images that were almost entirely created via prompting, including ones with simple edits or clean-up, are not what this site is for. Please check [tantabus.ai](https://tantabus.ai/) if youâ€™re interested in such content.
> -   `ai composition` images must not display any AI-related errors. See [this page](https://derpibooru.org/pages/aiquality) for details.

The [tagging guidelines on Derpibooru](https://derpibooru.org/pages/tags) are similar to those on [Tantabus](#tantabus). The most important difference is that `ai generated` art **isn't allowed on Derpibooru**! Only `ai composition` is allowed.

In general, tagging guidelines between Derpibooru and Tantabus are almost the same except for the difference above, however they may slightly diverge as these sites evolve independently, so refer to the specific site's tagging guidelines to be sure.
