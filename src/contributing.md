The goal is to keep this website up-to-date with the state of AI technology evolution, and document the new techniques for AI artistry once they are discovered to share them with the world.

For this, we need a healthy community of AI artists and people willing to share their knowledge here. If you know something, that isn't covered by this guide yet, and you'd like to share your creative workflow with the world, then feel free to open a pull request and edit this guide.

Use the "Edit this page on Github" link at the bottom of the relevant page. Alternatively, fork and clone [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/MareStare/twai) manually to edit/add new pages if you prefer the comfort of your code editor.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them on the [Tantabus Discord server](https://tantabus.ai/pages/discord).
