# Contributing

The goal is to keep this website up-to-date with the AI technology evolution, and document new techniques for AI artistry once they are discovered.

For this, we need a healthy community of AI artists and people willing to share their knowledge here. If you know something, that isn't covered by this guide yet, and you'd like to share your creative workflow with the world, then feel free to open a pull request and edit this guide.

Use the "Edit this page on Github" link at the bottom of the relevant chapter. Alternatively, fork and clone [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/MareStare/twai) manually to edit/add new pages if you prefer the comfort of your code editor. See the [`Contributing` paragraph](https://github.com/MareStare/twai#contributing) in the repository `README.md` file for more details.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them on the [Tantabus Discord server](https://tantabus.ai/pages/discord).
