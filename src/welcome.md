# Welcome

Welcome to the pony AI art guide üëã! It's a handbook created with the purpose to teach you how to generate, compose and edit beautiful pony ü¶Ñ images using AI.

<!-- TODO: add some beautiful AI-generated image of twilight here -->

## Who is This Guide for?

This guide is perfect for absolute beginners. You don't need to be a software developer, a mathematician or an artist to follow üê±. You'll learn the important concepts behind generating AI pony images from scratch step by step.

If you already have some experience with AI art, you may still find useful things here that will improve your existing creative workflows.

## Reproducing Twai Icon Pony

While most of the other guides on AI art show examples of photorealistic images and humans, we'll instead focus specifically on generating cartoon-style ponies from the "My Little Pony" series.

Let's set our initial goal to generate the Twilight Sparkle image Icon of the Twai website (yes it was AI-generated):

### Installing the Software

While there is a number of online AI art generators, 99% of AI artists don't use them because of their limitations. If you want to generate high quality AI art, you'll need to use your own computer and GPU for generating the images (this is called "local" generation).

Go to the next page to learn about the software for AI art generation and how to install it.
