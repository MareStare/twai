# Welcome

Welcome to the pony AI art guide üëã! It's a handbook created with the purpose of teaching you how to generate, compose and edit beautiful pony ü¶Ñ images using AI.

<!-- TODO: add some beautiful AI-generated image of twilight here -->

## Who is This Guide for?

This guide is perfect for absolute beginners. You don't need to be a software developer, a mathematician or an artist to follow üê±. You'll learn the important concepts behind generating AI pony images from scratch step by step.

If you already have some experience with AI art, you may still find useful things here that will improve your existing creative workflows.

## Reproducing Twai Brand Pony

While most of the other guides on AI art show examples of photorealistic images and humans, we'll instead focus specifically on generating cartoon-style ponies from the "My Little Pony" series.

Let's set our initial goal to generate the Twilight Sparkle image brand of the Twai website (yes it was AI-generated):

    <img src="/twai-brand.png" width="300px" data-figure></img>
</p>

Yes, you can easily reproduce the image above, if you use the same prompt and configuration parameters. To do that, we'll need to install some software for AI art generation.

Let's go to the next page to learn about the required software and how to install it.
