# Welcome :wave:

Welcome to the pony AI art guide! It's a handbook created with the purpose of teaching you how to generate, compose and edit beautiful pony ü¶Ñ images using AI.

::: warning

‚ö†Ô∏è The guide is the process of bootstrapping, and thus it's lacking a bunch of crucial chapters! [@MareStare] will make a blog post and feature it on Tantabus forums, in [Tantabus discord](https://tantabus.ai/pages/discord) and elsewhere once the initial MVP of the guide is finished.

If you'd like to offer your help and contribute, see [Contributing](./contributing) for details. Your help is important because [@MareStare]'s knowledge about AI art is still incomplete. It's very likely you may have some knowledge, that [@MareStare] and other beginner (or even more experienced) AI artists don't possess, and you could share that knowledge here.

## Who is This Guide for?

This guide is perfect for absolute beginners. You don't need to be a software developer, a mathematician or an artist to follow üê±. You'll learn the important concepts behind generating AI pony images from scratch step by step.

If you already have some experience with AI art, you may still find useful things here that will improve your existing creative workflows.

## Reproducing the Cover Art Image

While most of the other guides on AI art show examples of photorealistic images and humans, we'll instead focus specifically on generating cartoon-style ponies from the "My Little Pony" series.

Let's set our initial goal to generate the cover art image of this guide, that you can see at the top of this page. You can reproduce it, if you use the same prompt and configuration parameters. To do that, we'll need to install some software for AI art generation first.

Let's go to the next page to learn about the required software and how to install it.
