Derpibooru has strict content requirements for AI art. Citing [their rules](https://derpibooru.org/pages/rules):

> - Do not upload purely `ai generated` images. AI can be used as a tool to edit or create images, such as for `ai composition` content, but not as the only tool. Images that were almost entirely created via prompting, including ones with simple edits or clean-up, are not what this site is for. Please check [tantabus.ai](https://tantabus.ai/) if youâ€™re interested in such content.
> - `ai composition` images must not display any AI-related errors. See [this page](https://derpibooru.org/pages/aiquality) for details.

The [tagging guidelines on Derpibooru](https://derpibooru.org/pages/tags) are similar to those on [Tantabus](./tantabus). The most important difference is that `ai generated` art **isn't allowed on Derpibooru**! Only `ai composition` is allowed.

In general, tagging guidelines between Derpibooru and Tantabus are almost the same except for the difference above, however they may slightly diverge as these sites evolve independently, so refer to the specific site's tagging guidelines to be sure.
