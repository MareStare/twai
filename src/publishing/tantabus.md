This is the go-to website for posting almost any AI art with ponies. It is central to AI pony artists community, and we'd be glad to see your works here! You can post fully generated or edited AI art rating from SFW to NSFW with reasonable quality.

Citing the [relevant site rules](https://tantabus.ai/pages/rules):

> Images not made by or with AI should have a clear relation to the topic, or oneâ€™s workflow. For example, a guide on how to use a tool, or a sketch to be used for a controlnet image.

Now let's learn how to properly tag our AI art.

## `ai generated` tag

This tag is for images, that were purely AI generated with little to no editing and clean-up. They must follow [the base quality standards](https://tantabus.ai/pages/aibasequality) and have the following tags:

```tags
ai content, ai generated, prompter:{author_name}
```

## `ai composition` tag

This tag is for images, that were heavily edited, used extensive inpainting, were based on a hand-made sketch or alike. They must follow [the higher quality standards](https://tantabus.ai/pages/aicompquality) and should be tagged with:

```tags
ai content, ai composition, editor:{author_name}
```

::: tip ðŸ‘€

Notice the difference in `editor`/`prompter` tags between `ai generated` and `ai composition`.

See the [tag guidelines](https://tantabus.ai/pages/tags) for more.

## History

This whole guide was written at the time when Tantabus was [spun off from Derpibooru](https://derpibooru.org/forums/meta/topics/policy-update-regarding-ai-content) and became a home for AI pony artists.
